## ‚ùì What is WGet.NET

WGet.NET is a WinGet wrapper library for .Net.

I created it for another project and then made a library out of it in hope it might be usefull to someone else too.  
**If you tried this library, please give me some feedback. And if you miss a feature, you can create an issue to let me know.**

## üéà Version 2.0

Version 2.0 is out now, with big changes, improvements and new features.  
But before updating to the new version, read the changelog first, because version 2.0 is not compatible with older versions of this library.

## üì¶ NuGet Package

You can get the NuGet package here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/WGet.NET/

## ‚ùó Requirements

WinGet needs to be installed on the system.

If WinGet is not installed on your system you can get it here: https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli

## üí° Getting started 

The needed namespace is **WGetNET** (`using WGetNET;`).  
This namespace contains the three classes, that are used to perform actions or get information with winget.

### WinGetInfo:  
The ***WinGetInfo*** class can be used to get information about WinGet itself.  
This class is inherited by the ***WinGetPackageManager*** and ***WinGetSourceManager*** class.

USing this class to check if winget is installed could look like this:
```csharp
WinGetInfo wingetInfo = new WinGetInfo();
if (wingetInfo.WinGetInstalled)
{
     Console.WriteLine("WinGet is installed.");
}
else
{
     Console.WriteLine("WinGet is NOT installed.");
}
```

### WinGetPackageManager:  
The ***WinGetPackageManager*** class is used for everything that has to do with packages.  
It can install, remove, upgrade, search, list, export and import packages.

The code for installing a package could look like this:
```csharp
WinGetPackageManager packageManager = new WinGetPackageManager();
packageManager.InstallPackage("Git.Git");
```

### WinGetSourceManager:  
The ***WinGetSourceManager*** class is used for everything that has to do with sources.  
It can list, add, update, export, reset and remove sources.

***To use the add, remove and reset functions, the process needs to have administrator privileges.  
(WinGet can‚Äôt perform these actions without administrator privileges)***

The code for adding a source could look like this:
```csharp
WinGetSourceManager sourceManager = new WinGetSourceManager();
sourceManager.AddSource("msstore", "https://storeedgefd.dsx.mp.microsoft.com/v9.0", "Microsoft.Rest");
```
