## What is WGet.NET

WGet.NET is a .net library that allows you to use WinGet in your .net application.

I created it for another project and then made a library out of it in hope it might be usefull to someone else too.<br>
Therefore the functions are limited at the moment.<br>
**If you tried this library, give me some feedback. And if you miss a feature, create an issue to let me know.**
