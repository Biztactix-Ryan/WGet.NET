## ‚ùì What is WGet.NET

WGet.NET is a WinGet wrapper library for .Net.

I created it for another project and then made a library out of it in hope it might be usefull to someone else too.<br>
Therefore the functions are limited at the moment.<br>
**If you tried this library, please give me some feedback. And if you miss a feature, you can create an issue to let me know.**

## üéà Version 2.0

Version 2.0 is out now, with big changes, improvements and new features.  
But before updating to the new version, read the changelog first, because version 2.0 is not compatible with older versions of this library.

You can finde the changelog here: https://github.com/basicx-StrgV/WGet.NET/releases/tag/2.0.0
