# Migrating from Version 3.x.x to Version 4.x.x

Version 4.x.x contains some braking changes.  
Therefore it might be needed to change the implementation in your code.  
This document lists all braking changes and information on how to change the implementation.

***No previous existing functionality is lost with the update to version 4.0 or higher.  
Everything as an equal replacement.*** 

## Creating a WinGetPackage instance
In version 3 or older it was possible to create an instance of the `WinGetPackage` class from outside the library by using its constructor and setting ist properties.
``` csharp
WinGetPackage instance = new WinGetPackage()
{
  Name = "Sample",
  Id = "SampleId",
  Version = "1.0"
}; 
```

This is no longer possible in version 4.0.0 or newer, because there is no longer a public constructor and all properties are now read only.

As a replacement, there is a new static create method for the `WinGetPackage` class,  
that is better managed and has multiple overloads to provide a better way of creating a `WinGetPackage` class instance from outside the library.

``` csharp
WinGetPackage instance = WinGetPackage.Create("Sample", "SampleId", "1.0");
```

## Creating a WinGetSource instance
In version 3 or older it was possible to create an instance of the `WinGetSource` class from outside the library by using its constructor and setting ist properties.
``` csharp
WinGetSource instance = new WinGetSource()
{
  Name = "Sample",
  Url = "https://sample.com",
  Type = "Sample.Type"
}; 
```

This is no longer possible in version 4.0.0 or newer, because there is no longer a public constructor and all properties are now read only.

As a replacement, there is a new static create method for the `WinGetSource` class,  
that is better managed and has multiple overloads to provide a better way of creating a `WinGetSource` class instance from outside the library.

``` csharp
WinGetSource instance = WinGetSource.Create("Sample", "SampleId", "https://sample.com", "Sample.Type");
```

## Exceptions
Exceptions were previously in the main namespace `WGetNET`.  
To improve the structure of the library all exceptions were moved to their own namespace.  
The new namespace for exceptions is `WGetNET.Exceptions`.
